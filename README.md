# Pig-Game
Pig Game is a very simple dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points by taking turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all the roll results to a current score, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. This project is build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project is not responsive.

Gameplay:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to “hold”:
• If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player’s turn.
• If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player’s turn continues.
• If a player chooses to “hold”, their current score is added to their score, and it becomes the next player’s turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins the game.
